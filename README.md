# Sparse Matrix Project

## Overview

This project is all about working with sparse matrices in Python. It includes a Sparse Matrix class that makes it easy to store and manipulate large matrices, especially when most of the elements are zeros. The class comes with useful methods for loading matrices from files, saving them, and performing different operations.

## Features

- Load sparse matrices from text files.
- Save sparse matrices to text files.
- Perform basic operations like addition and multiplication, etc.
- Handle errors when file formats aren't correct.
